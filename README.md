# Sondre's PowerShell Modules

- A collection of Modules I began working on during the christmas of 2024, when I swapped from Bash to PowerShell and took a strong liking to the syntax and simplicity that is PowerShell âœ¨

## Installation

- Clone the repo and add the `Modules` folder to your PSModulePath environment variable.
